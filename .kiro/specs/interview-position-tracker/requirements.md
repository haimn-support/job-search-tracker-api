# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a REST API backend system that allows software developers to track job positions they are interviewing for and monitor related statistics. The system will provide comprehensive position management capabilities, interview stage tracking, and statistical insights to help users manage their job search process effectively. The backend will connect to a cloud-based SQL database and serve a frontend application through RESTful endpoints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to add new job positions I'm applying to, so that I can keep track of all my applications in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits position details THEN the system SHALL store the position with company name, job title, description, application date, and status
2. WHEN a user creates a position THEN the system SHALL assign a unique identifier to the position
3. WHEN a user provides invalid position data THEN the system SHALL return validation errors with specific field requirements
4. WHEN a position is successfully created THEN the system SHALL return the created position with its assigned ID

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to update the status and details of my job applications, so that I can track my progress through different interview stages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user updates a position status THEN the system SHALL record the status change with timestamp
2. WHEN a user updates position details THEN the system SHALL validate the changes before saving
3. WHEN a user provides an invalid position ID THEN the system SHALL return a not found error
4. WHEN a position is successfully updated THEN the system SHALL return the updated position data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to view all my job applications, so that I can see an overview of my current job search status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests their positions THEN the system SHALL return all positions associated with their account
2. WHEN a user requests positions with filters THEN the system SHALL return positions matching the specified criteria
3. WHEN a user requests positions with pagination THEN the system SHALL return results in the specified page size and offset
4. WHEN no positions exist for a user THEN the system SHALL return an empty list

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to delete job positions I no longer want to track, so that I can keep my application list clean and relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user deletes a position THEN the system SHALL remove the position and all associated data
2. WHEN a user attempts to delete a non-existent position THEN the system SHALL return a not found error
3. WHEN a position is successfully deleted THEN the system SHALL return a confirmation response
4. WHEN a position has associated interview records THEN the system SHALL delete those records as well

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to track different interview stages for each position, so that I can monitor my progress through the hiring process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds an interview stage THEN the system SHALL store the stage with date, type, and notes
2. WHEN a user updates an interview stage THEN the system SHALL record the changes with timestamp
3. WHEN a user views position details THEN the system SHALL include all associated interview stages
4. WHEN an interview stage is created THEN the system SHALL validate the stage type and date

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a job seeker, I want to view statistics about my job search, so that I can analyze my application success rates and identify patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests statistics THEN the system SHALL calculate total applications, response rates, and stage conversion rates
2. WHEN a user requests statistics by time period THEN the system SHALL filter data within the specified date range
3. WHEN a user requests statistics by company or position type THEN the system SHALL group results accordingly
4. WHEN insufficient data exists for statistics THEN the system SHALL return appropriate default values or messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API to handle authentication and authorization, so that users can only access their own data securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes an API request without authentication THEN the system SHALL return an unauthorized error
2. WHEN a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error
3. WHEN a user accesses another user's data THEN the system SHALL return a forbidden error
4. WHEN a user provides valid authentication THEN the system SHALL allow access to their own resources

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to connect to a cloud SQL database, so that data is persisted reliably and can scale as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL establish a connection to the cloud SQL database
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL handle connection errors gracefully
3. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
4. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL ensure ACID compliance for all transactions
